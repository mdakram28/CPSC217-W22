### 1. Exercises in PyCharm (Optional)

PyCharm Edu has some interactive courses which give you exercises to practice programming concepts.

For opening the interactive learning course. 

1. Click on `File` in the toolbar. 
2. Goto `learn` > `Browse Crouses`. 
3. Select a course from the list and click on `start` button on the right panel.

### 2. Intro to python

1. **Variables**

  - Variables allow us to store some data in the computers memory for later use.

  - Variables are created with a name and can be accessed using that name later in the code. e.g.:

    ```python
    my_variable = 123
    my_variable = 456
    ```

  - Variables are destroyed when the program terminates

  - Variables can hold data of different types. eg:

    ```python
    # Integer 
    a = 5
    # Floating Point
    b = 3.12
    # String
    s = "1.234"
    s_as_num = float(s)
    ```

2. **Expressions**

   - An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, operands, and calls to functions which evaluate to some result during execution.
   - Expressions can appear at the right hand side of variable assignment. In that case the result of the expression is stored in the variable.
   - Operators: +, -, *, /, ** (exponentiation), // (integer division), % (remainder)
   - e.g.
     - `1+2`
     - `(2*a) + (3*b)`

3. **IO**

   - Input: Take input from the user using the in built input() function. e.g.:

     ```python
     user_name = input("Enter your name")
     ```

   - Output: Print using the in built print() function. e.g.: 

     ```python
     print("Welcome to CPSC 217", "Good Morning")
     print("The user's name is", user_name)
     ```

4. **Casting**

   - In order to convert from one data type to another we use casting functions in python: **int(), float(), str()**, etc

   - When we call the input() function, it evalutes to a string data type. If we need to take in floating point input we will have to wrap the input() function inside a float() casting function. e.g.:

     ```python
     number = float(input("Enter a number"))
     ```

### 3. Exercise

Write a python program to 

1. Get the current temperature in fahrenheit from the user
2. Convert it to celsius
3. Print the converted temperature

$$
C = \frac{(F - 32) * 5}{9}
$$

**Solution**

```python
# 1. Get the current temperature in fahrenheit from the user
temp_f = float(input("Enter the temperature in fahrenheit: "))
# 2. Convert it to celsius
temp_c = ((temp_f - 32) * 5) / 9
# 3. Print the converted temperature
print("Temperature in celsius:", temp_c)
```
